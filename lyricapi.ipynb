      "At first, I thought, “I’m just going to rap,” but then later on down the line, literally probably two, three songs before “Old Town Road,” it’s like, “I’m going to do what I want to do. I’m going to make the music I want to make, and if people like it, then they like it. If they don’t, then they don’t.” Before it was even taken off the country charts, I was just happy to be on Billboard at all. Even after they did take it off, I was like, “Okay, at least I’m still on Billboard.” Then, I started to think about, I was like, “Why?” After listening to other songs that’s actually on that chart, it’s like, “Wait a minute, something’s not right, basically.” Then it felt amazing to get support from country stars because it’s like this is their lane. It’s like you’re getting respect from people who’ve been doing this for some time. This is my first time dabbling into anything country influenced.\n",
